# E-commerce Backend API Guide

## Quick start

The default API root is:

```text
http://localhost:<PORT>/api/v1
```

Replace `<PORT>` with the value of `port` in `.env`.

Protected User APIs require a customer access token. Admin APIs require an access token whose account role is `admin`, `superAdmin`, or (for order management) `orderManager`.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

Image endpoints use `multipart/form-data`; do not manually set the multipart boundary. Product, category, and profile uploads use the field name `User_image`. Banner uploads use `banner_image`.

## Authentication workflow

1. Register with `POST /user/auth/create` (optionally include `referralCode`).
2. Verify the account with `POST /user/auth/email-verify` using the verification data sent by the backend.
3. Log in with `POST /user/auth/login`.
4. Copy the access token from the login response and send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
5. When the access token expires, call `/user/auth/refresh-token` with the refresh token.

Register:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/user/auth/create" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Email":"customer@example.com","Password":"StrongPassword123!","referralCode":"OPTIONALCODE"}'
```

Login:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/user/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Email":"customer@example.com","Password":"StrongPassword123!"}'
```

Refresh token:

```json
{ "refreshToken": "<refresh-token>" }
```

### Page analytics

The canonical route uses the User API prefix. The former `/analytics` URL remains a compatibility alias.

| Method | Endpoint | Authentication | Input |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/user/analytics/track-page` | No | `{ "path": "/products", "name": "Products" }` |

Each request increments the stored view count for the supplied page path.

### Razorpay payment checkout

The former `/payment` URLs remain compatibility aliases.

| Method | Endpoint | Authentication | Input |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/user/payment/razorpay/order` | User | Checkout items, address, optional coupon/wallet, and idempotency key |
| POST | `/user/payment/razorpay/verify` | User | Razorpay order, payment, and signature fields |

Create a Razorpay payment order:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "productId": "<product-id>", "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "shippingAddress": {
    "fullName": "Example Customer",
    "phone": "9876543210",
    "address": "12 Market Road",
    "city": "Jaipur",
    "state": "Rajasthan",
    "pincode": "302001",
    "country": "India"
  },
  "coupon": null,
  "useWallet": false,
  "idempotencyKey": "checkout_20260714_001"
}
```

The idempotency key must contain 16–100 letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens. Reusing it prevents duplicate payment intents.

Verify payment:

```json
{
  "razorpay_order_id": "order_...",
  "razorpay_payment_id": "pay_...",
  "razorpay_signature": "..."
}
```

### Returns

The former `/return` URLs remain compatibility aliases.

| GET | `/user/returns/:id` | User | Get an owned return request |

```json
{
  "orderId": "<delivered-order-id>",
  "productId": "<product-id>",
  "quantity": 1,
  "reason": "Product arrived damaged",
  "details": "The outer edge is cracked.",
  "proofImages": ["https://example.com/proof-1.jpg"]
}
```

The order must belong to the user and have status `Delivered`. `proofImages` accepts up to five image URL strings. Only one return request is allowed per user/order/product combination.

| DELETE | `/admin/categories/delete/:categoryId` | None |

### Orders

| Method | Endpoint | Input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/admin/orders/all` | None |
| PATCH | `/admin/orders/:orderId/status` | `{ "orderStatus": "Shipped" }` |

Supported statuses are defined by the order model: `Pending`, `Confirmed`, `Packed`, `Shipped`, `Out For Delivery`, `Delivered`, and `Cancelled`.

### Banners

### Coupons

| Method | Endpoint | Input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/admin/coupons` | None |
| POST | `/admin/coupons` | Coupon JSON |
| PUT | `/admin/coupons/:id` | Partial coupon JSON |
| DELETE | `/admin/coupons/:id` | None |

```json
{
  "targetType": "all",
  "discountType": "percentage",
  "discountValue": 10,
  "startDate": "2026-07-11",
  "expireDate": "2026-12-31",
  "maxLimit": 1,
  "minPurchaseAmount": 500,
  "isActive": true
}
```

`targetType` accepts `all`, `category`, or `product`. Supply `category_id` or `product_id` for the corresponding target. `discountType` accepts `percentage` or `fixed`. `customerEmail` can restrict the coupon to an existing user.

### Inventory

| GET | `/admin/inventory/:productId` | None |
| PUT | `/admin/inventory/:productId` | `{ "stock": 25, "note": "Restocked" }` |

Important: the existing implementation only protects `insert-missing`; the other inventory routes currently have no Admin middleware. This documentation does not treat that as recommended behavior.

### Reviews, policies, and audit logs

| Method | Endpoint | Input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/admin/reviews/all?productId=&status=&search=` | Optional filters |
| PATCH | `/admin/reviews/:reviewId/status` | `{ "status": "hidden" }` or `published` |

| DELETE | `/admin/policies/delete/:id` | None |
| GET | `/admin/audit-logs?action=&module=&search=` | Optional filters |

Policy payload:

```json
{
  "title": "Privacy Policy",
  "slug": "privacy-policy",
  "heading": "Privacy Policy",

  "position": 1
}
```

### Analytics and returns

For `pickup_scheduled`, optionally include `pickupScheduledAt`. Valid transitions are enforced by the API across `pending`, `approved`, `pickup_scheduled`, `received`, `refunded`, and `rejected`.

### Homepage settings

The former `/homepage` URLs remain compatibility aliases.

```json
{
  "bestsellerCategoryId": "<category-id>",
  "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
}
```

Send an empty `bestsellerCategoryId` to remove the selected category. The current update path is case-sensitive and contains uppercase `Update-settings`.

### Referral administration

The former `/referral/admin/*` URLs remain compatibility aliases.

| Method | Endpoint | Input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/admin/referrals/settings` | None |
| PUT | `/admin/referrals/settings` | Reward settings JSON |
| GET | `/admin/referrals/stats` | None |

## Common HTTP responses

- `200`: successful read/update/delete.
- `201`: resource created.
- `400`: invalid or missing input.
- `401`: missing, invalid, or expired access token.
- `403`: authenticated account lacks permission or is blocked.
- `404`: resource not found.
- `500`: server/database/provider error.

## Image storage

Set `IMAGE_STORAGE_PROVIDER` to `local`, `cloudinary`, or `s3`. The required provider credentials are listed in `.env.example`. Existing deployments that only set `USE_CLOUDINARY=true` remain supported as a compatibility fallback.
